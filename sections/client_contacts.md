{
    "name": "James Mick",
    "client_id": 1,
    "email": "james@ea.com",
    "phone": "577-293-1857"
}
```

### Required fields

When creating a client: `name`, `client_id`.

<a name="update"></a>
## Updating a client contact

To update an existing client contact, make a POST or PUT request to:

* `/api/clientcontacts/[CONTACT_ID]`

with the request body containing the updated info. You can send only the changed fields.

Example of request body if you want to change the contact name and phone number:

```json
{
    "name": "James Mick Jr.",
    "phone": "578-293-1857"
}
```

The response will return `200 OK` and will contain the updated client contact info as in the **Getting a client contact** section.

<a name="access"></a>
## Giving access to clients portal

To give a client contact access to the clients portal, make an update request with the following body:

```json
{
    "access": true,
    "password": "secret"
}
```

The client contact will be able to login into clients portal using his email and provided password.

To remove access, make the update request with the following body:

```json
{
    "access": false
}
```

<a name="add-image"></a>
## Adding a client contact profile image 

To add a client contact profile image, make a POST request to:

* `/api/clientcontacts/[CONTACT_ID]`

The request content-type should be `multipart-form-data` and the file field name equal to `image`. Here's an example using `curl` command line:

```shell
curl -u email:password
  -H 'Accept: application/json'
  -F "image=@photo.jpg"
  https://app.paymoapp.com/api/clientcontacts/12345

The profile image of a client contact can be added when creating the client contact. In that case, all the client contact fields should be send in `multipart-form-data` format together with the file.
