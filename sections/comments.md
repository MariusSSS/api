<a name="create"></a>
## Creating a comment

To create a comment, make a POST request to:

* `/api/comments`

with the request body containing the new comment info. If you know the `thread_id` you can send it in the request body, or you can send the `discussion_id`, or `task_id`, or `file_id` if you are adding the comment to a discussion, or task, or file.

An example of adding a comment to a task:

```json
{
    "task_id": 12345,
    "content": "Please review my changes"
}
```

If successful, the response will return `201 Created`. The response header `Location` will contain a link for the new comment. The response body will contain the new comment info as in the **Getting a comment** section.

### Required fields

When creating a comment: `content` and one field from the group (`thread_id`, `task_id`, `discussion_id`, `file_id`).

<a name="update"></a>
## Updating a comment

To update an existing comment, make a POST or PUT request to:

* `/api/comments/[COMMENT_ID]`

with the request body containing the updated info. You can send only the changed fields.

Example of request body if you want to change the comment due date:

```json
{
    "content": "[Updated comment] Forget all I have said before" 
}
```

The response will return `200 OK` and will contain the updated comment info as in the **Getting a comment** section.

<a name="add-file"></a>
## Attaching a file to a comment

To add a file to a task, make a POST request to:

* `/api/comments/[COMMENT_ID]`

The request content-type should be `multipart-form-data` and the file field name equal to `file`. Here's an example using `curl` command line:

```shell
curl -u email:password
  -H 'Accept: application/json'
  -F "file=@screenshot.png"
  https://app.paymoapp.com/api/comments/12345
```

The file can also be added when creating the comment. In that case, all the comment fields should be send in `multipart-form-data` format together with the file.

<a name="delete"></a>
## Deleting a comment

To delete a comment, make a DELETE request to:

* `/api/comments/[COMMENT_ID]`
