## Getting invoices

You can list invoices by making a GET request to:

* `/api/invoices` for a list of all the invoices
* `/api/invoices?where=client_id=[CLIENT_ID]` for a list of invoices for a specific client
* `/api/invoices?where=status=paid` for a list of paid invoices
* `/api/invoices?where=status in ("draft","void")` for a list of all draft and void invoices
* `/api/invoices?where=total>100` for a list of all invoices with a total greater than 100

The list above is not exhausted. You can combine multiple conditions as in:

* `/api/invoices?where=client_id=[CLIENT_ID] and status=draft` for a list of draft invoices for a specific client

## Creating an invoice

To create an invoice, make a POST request to:

* `/api/invoices`

with the request body containing the new invoice info including the invoice items (lines), as in the example below:

```json
{
   "date":"2015-02-24",
   "due_date":"2015-03-24",
   "client_id":10869,
   "currency":"USD",
   "number":"INV-488",
   "company_info":"Company Info\nMore info",
   "bill_to":"Billing Info\nMore info",
   "tax":20,
   "items":[
	  {
		 "item":"Item 1",
		 "description":"Description & specs for item 1",
		 "price_unit":5.5,
		 "quantity":2
	  },
	  {
		 "item":"Item 2",
		 "description":"Description\nFor Item 2",
		 "price_unit":159,
		 "quantity":1
	  }
   ]
}
```

If successful, the response will return `201 Created`. The response header `Location` will contain a link for the new invoice. The response body will contain the new invoice info as in the **Getting an invoice** section.

### Required fields

When creating an invoice: `client_id`, `currency`.
For a complete description of all invoice fields, see [invoice object](#object).

### Invoice items

Invoice items are defined in `items` property of the request object. It is an array of objects, each one having the following keys:

* `item` represents the name of the invoice item
* `description` (optional) more details about the item
* `price_unit` (decimal) price per unit (the currency is the same as that of the invoice)
* `quantity` (decimal) item quantity
* `expense_id` (optional) identifies the expense that is invoiced
* `apply_tax` (boolean) (optional) whether or not to apply tax to this item (usually tax does not apply for expenses)
* `seq` (int) (optional) specifies the position of this invoice item among the items list
* `entries` (array of entries ids) (optional) a list of entries that will be marked as billed (it is used when billing time from timesheets)

### Invoice number

When creating an invoice, if you don't provide an invoice number, Paymo will automatically create one using the number format and next invoice number from Company Settings (`invoice_format` and `next_invoice_number` attributes of the company object).

If you provide your custom number, this number will be checked against existing invoice number. In case there is already an invoice with the provided number, the creation of the new invoice will fail.
After each new invoice is created (either the invoice number is automatically assigned or custom defined) the value of `next_invoice_number` will be incremented.

<a name="create-from-estimate"></a>
### Creating an invoice from an estimate

When creating an invoice from an estimate, you should submit an additional field `estimate_id`. This will update the estimate status to `invoiced`.
Note that you have to provide all the usual invoice information including invoice items.

<a name="update"></a>
## Updating an invoice

To update an existing invoice, make a POST or PUT request to:

* `/api/invoices/[INVOICE_ID]`

with the request body containing the updated info. You can send only the changed fields.

Example of request body if you want to change the invoice footer and 'bill to' info:

```json
{
    "footer": "Thank you for your business",
    "bill_to": "Acme, Inc.\nSan Jose, CA"
}
```

The response will return `200 OK` and will contain the updated invoice info as in the **Getting an invoice** section.

## Updating invoice items

When updating an invoice you can also add/update/remove invoice items.
If the update request has an `items` field, this will set the new invoice items.

For example, if we update an invoice with 3 invoice items with IDs equal to 100, 101, 102 and we want to:
* keep invoice item with ID=100 unchanged
* modify `quantity` to 2 for invoice item with ID=101
* remove invoice item with ID=102
* add new invoice item with `price`=20 and `qty`=1

the update request will look like:

```json
{
    "items": [
        {
            "id": 100
        },
        {
            "id": 101,
            "quantity": 2
        },
        {
            "item": "New item",
            "price_unit": 20,
            "quantity": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

After any update the invoice `subtotal`, `tax_amount`, `tax2_amount`, `discount_amount` and `total` fields will also be updated.

## Changing invoice status

An invoice can be in one of the following states: `draft`, `sent`, `viewed`, `paid` and `void`.
Invoice status will change automatically in some situations:

* When a new invoice is created, it will be `draft`.
* An invoice sent to a client by email from the Paymo app will be automatically changed to `sent`.
* When a client opens an invoice with the `sent` status, if will change to `viewed`.
* When the sum of payments for the invoice reaches invoice total, the invoice becomes `paid`.

You can also change the status manually, by making an update request with the new status.

For example, to change the invoice status to `void`, make an update request with the following body:

```json
{
    "status": "void"
}
```

<a name="delete"></a>
## Deleting an invoice

To delete an invoice, make a DELETE request to:

* `/api/invoices/[INVOICE_ID]`

If successful, the response will have a `200 OK` status code.

<a name="object"></a>
